          At the end of this summer, my partner and I decided to test out our
          some new camping equipment including a new box/ cage for Emma that
          attaches to our e-bikes by over-nighting at a local camp site.

              Before we head off it is important for her to get used to her new
              bike box. Without the top on....

              She doesn't look at all happy to be on the back of the bike with
              the top on! Although I think it is just as much that it isn't as
              stable. Poor little thing looks miserable!

              But once on the road, she seemed happy enough and started chewing
              a bone. She isn't even looking where we are going! (Hover over for
              a close up)

              After a long bike ride (wasn't actually very long) it is important
              to have a little nap on a camping chair. Especially since I don't
              trust her to be off the leash this close to so many people.

              She definitely found her corner of the tent for the night. Down at
              the foot end as usual.

              And in the morning, it is important to be close to the coffee and
              breakfast queue! ðŸ˜‰ What a lovely view...
